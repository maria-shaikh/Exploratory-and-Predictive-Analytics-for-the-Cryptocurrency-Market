# Exploratory-and-Predictive-Analytics-for-the-Cryptocurrency-Market
This project uses several different Python libraries to perform exploratory and predictive analytics on the volatile cryptocurrency market

## Project Summary
The cryptocurrency market, with its impressive underlying technology and enormous price fluctuations has gained the interest of many in the recent years. As of August 2022, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies stood at $1.1 trillion, which is about 2.5% of the U.S. equity market capitalization. Recent unfortunate events like the Terra controversey and the FTX collapse have plagued the trust in digital currencies, however, I believe that they are here to stay. This project analyses and predicts prices for the cryptocurrencies that are dominating the market in terms of market capitalization. The goal is to help individuals further understand trends and seasonalities in price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies, as well as predict future prices using the most important factors that influence daily returns.

## Data
The cryptocurrencies that we are analysing in this project are:
1. Bitcoin (BTC)    
2. Ethereum (ETH)

6. Dogecoin (DOGE)
